however, were made to the young Princess, and it was determined that
her return should be accomplished with a respectful magnificence
and ceremony. She left Versailles April 5, 1725, and on reaching
the frontier, she was exchanged at Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port for the
two Princesses of Orleans (the widow of King Louis and Mademoiselle
de Beaujolais). Married in 1729 to Joseph Emanuel, then Prince,
afterwards King of Portugal, “she gave that sovereign,” says Voltaire,
“the children she was not allowed to give to Louis XV. and was not
happier on account of it.” As to the two Princesses of Orleans, their
destiny was unhappy: the queen dowager of Spain, who died in 1742,
lived in poverty, with a barren title and the simulacrum of a court.
Her two families had but one thought,--that of ridding themselves of
the support of this unfortunate young woman. Spain showed excessive
negligence in the payment of her pension, and after having reigned
over one of the principal kingdoms of the world, she was obliged,
by economical reasons, to spend three consecutive years with the
Carmelites of Paris. Still living, she was treated as if already
dead. Her sister, Mademoiselle de Beaujolais, so amiable, sweet, and
attractive, retained a tender memory of her former betrothed, Don
Carlos (the future Charles III.), who, on his side, did not forget her.
Possibly a means of renewing their engagement might have been found.
But the young girl died in 1734, carrying her faithful regret with her
to the tomb. She was not yet twenty.

The rupture of the marriage of Louis XV. was not a fortunate event.
The Prince was only fifteen years old. He might easily have waited
several years longer before marrying. His studies and his energy would
both have been the gainers by it. Moreover, it was an evil thing
to insult a great nation like Spain. It was not alone the Spanish
people that were outraged, but the glorious memory of the Infanta’s
great-grandfather, the grand King who had said: “There are no more
Pyrenees.” A fatal lesson was given to the young sovereign when he was
thus taught to violate sworn faith, and habituated from his adolescence
to those culpable caprices, those egotistic desertions of which his
reign was to afford more than one example.




                                  II

                    THE MARRIAGE OF MARIE LECZINSKA


In the year 1725, a poor exiled king and his family were living in a
dilapidated old commandery in Wissemburg, a little town of Alsace. This
king without a kingdom, this fugitive who dignified his poverty by the
resignation with which he endured misfortune, was the Pole, Stanislas
Leczinski, the protégé of Charles XII. of Sweden. Driven from Poland
after a very short reign, Stanislas had found an asylum in France, and
lived in Wissemburg in complete retirement with his mother, his wife,
his daughter, and several gentlemen who had been faithful to him in
misfortune. His daughter, Marie, born in Breslau, June 23, 1703, was
at this time twenty-two years old. Pious, gentle, and sympathetic,
she was the joy of the exiles. When they spoke to her of projected
marriages, she would say to her parents: “Do not think you can make me
happy by sending me away; it would be far sweeter to me to share your
ill-fortune than to enjoy, at a distance, a happiness which would not
be yours.” Her education had been as intelligent as it was austere. She
spent the time not occupied in prayer and study in working for the
poor of the city or embroidering ornaments for churches. She was a true
Christian, one of those admirable young girls whose charm has in it
something evangelic, and who make virtue lovable.

One day Stanislas, much moved, entered the room where his wife and
daughter were. “Let us kneel down,” he exclaimed, “and return thanks to
God!”--“Father,” said Marie, “have you been called back to the throne
of Poland?”--“Ah! daughter,” he replied, “Heaven is far more favorable
to us than that. You are Queen of France.” It was not a dream. The
