## Introduction

Understanding data structures and algorithms is fundamental for any Java developer. This repository provides implementations of common data structures and algorithms along with explanations and examples to help you understand and apply these concepts effectively.

## Data Structures

Here's a list of data structures currently implemented:

1. **Queue**: Implementation of a queue data structure.
2. **Stack**: Implementation of a stack data structure.
3. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Implementation of a binary search tree.

Each data structure includes detailed documentation and examples to demonstrate its usage.

## Sorting Algorithms

The Sorting package contains implementations of various sorting algorithms:

1. **Merge Sort**: Implementation of the merge sort algorithm.
2. **Quick Sort**: Implementation of the quick sort algorithm.

These sorting algorithms are highly object-oriented and optimized for efficiency.

## Contributing

Contributions are encouraged and welcome! If you have an implementation of a new data structure or algorithm, or if you'd like to improve existing code, feel free to open a pull request. 
If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.


## About This Read Me

Unloading grunt work on generative AI is an important skill for developers to learn.
For example, I asked OpenAI's ChatGPT to write this README for me. If you've got any particular ideas about how AI can take care of annoying work, please open a pull request on the README to tell me all about it.
